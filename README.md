# restaurateur
A basic restaurant plotting tool which can also load restaurant info from Google Places.
This is my first serious foray into the world of Web Client-side Development. 

Javascript libraries used
-------------------------
* [jQuery][1] -  I think it's already standard in all JS projects. 
* [Backbone][2] - MV* setup
* [RequireJS][3] - Module management
* [Underscore][4] - Utility library. I heard lodash is better but will save that for next time.
* [Backbone.localStorage][5] - plugin for easy storage of Backbone collections to browser localStorage.
* [RequireJS text][6] - plugin for loading text files. Used for loading template html files.
* [Bootstrap][7] - UI components
